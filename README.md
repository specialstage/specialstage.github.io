###Development

Special Stage is a passion project developed using sparetime. The conceptualisation and prototyping of Special Stage has been on going for 5+ years, however in the last few months a push has been made to make the game more usable and sharable.

Special Stage utilizes an iterative workflow to implement and improve features. Once a feature has been added, it is reworked periodically. This allows for features to be added quickly and tested by the audience, then reviewed and improved.

Special Stage is Open-Source. There are no advertisments or in app purchases. The user will never be interuppted by malware or have their progression blocked by a pay wall. Players will be able to review the source to reveal if any competitve mechanics are unfair.

The Special Stage source can also be reviewed for insight and education, as well as forked to create new projects. Special Stage is built using a custom engine utlizing Three.js.
